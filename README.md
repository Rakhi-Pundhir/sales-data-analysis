# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a data-driven Excel dashboard designed to analyze pizza sales over a specific period. The dashboard captures key performance indicators, sales trends, product performance by category and size, and identifies best/worst-selling pizzas to assist the business in making strategic decisions.
